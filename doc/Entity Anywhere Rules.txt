EAF Rules
1. Everything that can be a plugin, is a plugin.
2. Start with a customization for 1 entity. 
   If it becomes common, make it common to all entities.
3. Common features should work for all entities
4. Common features can be overridden easily.
5. A customizaton can inherit from common, to add one feature or endpoint.
6. Generic Extensions Entities, such as Addendum, are not used in Core Features, however, specific Extension Entities, such as AlternateIds, can be.
7. No duplicate data.
8. Don't load as a plugin something that must be referenced directly:
   Example: Custom Web Service to Custom Service.
9. Entities do not reference each other.
   - Each entity is in its own project and each entity interface is in its own project.
   - A consumer should be able to consume the interface without the Entity.

Code Best Practices
1. S.O.L.I.D.
2. 10/100 principle. No classes over 100 lines, no methods over 10 lines.
3. Use the existing style.
4. Trend toward the Odata spec.
