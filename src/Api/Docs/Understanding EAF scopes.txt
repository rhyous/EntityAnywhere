		  - Register plugin loader stuff
		- Inner scope build

Assign WCF scope to AutofacHostFactory.Container

per call (when a client makes a web service call)

- Code in Autofac
	- Wcfscope makes a PerCall scope
	  - Per Call Scope start
		- Register per call stuff
	  - Per call scope build
	- Per Call resolves WCF Service & dependencies
	
We have registrations in WCF Scope that fail to resolve,
without registrations in the Per Call scope.
 - Web SErvices plugin loader, registers it's registrar with 
   the WCF Scope
 - Costly to register everything per call
 - ServiceProxy allows for the service to be registered with
   the WCF Scope, but the real service to be loaded by the
   Per Call scope.
